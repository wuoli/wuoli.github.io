      <h2>About My Research</h2>
      <p>As a research assistant at Cedars-Sinai’s Department of Computational Biomedicine, I develop fair disease prediction models using genetic data and electronic health records (EHR). Many existing models fail to generalize across diverse populations, resulting in disparities in diagnosis and treatment. My work focuses on fine-tuning machine learning frameworks to enhance signal detection in underrepresented groups. I am also committed to making research more accessible by developing interactive, user-friendly programming tools. I was awarded first place at the 2024 Cedars-Sinai Research Intern Poster Symposium for my summer research project, which involved building software for a novel model my lab developed (soon to be published).</p>

              <p><b>Why Research?</b><br></br></p>
              <p>With many family members being researchers, I have had contact with the idea of research early on, visiting my father’s lab during the summer to learn about materials science research. During the winter quarter of my freshman year, I joined Dr. Matteo Pellegrini’s lab to work on dog genomic research on dog breed prediction. Then, I joined a summer internship with Dr. Ruowang Li’s lab at Cedars-Sinai, working on human genomic disease prediction. The internship really made me realize that I enjoy research’s versatility, impact, and bridging gaps between computer science and biomedicine. Therefore, I continued working as a research assistant with Dr. Li. My current research focuses on bias mitigation in disease prediction models.</p>

              <p>My cultural background made me fall in love with this interdisciplinary field. I really liked working with computers after taking my first programming course in Grade 7. Then, during covid, I started getting interested in biology, creating educational videos relating to biology. In Grade 10 during that period, my computer science teacher introduced us to Rosetta, a distributed computing program that gets computing resources from local participants to help with finding the right protein structure for COVID-19 vaccines. At that time, I participated in it using my out-dated computer that probably didn’t use much help, but I was so intrigued in the concept of solving medical problems using computers.</p>
